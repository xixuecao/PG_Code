删掉向量元素后，怎么弄成一个横向量
X =
16 2 13
5 11 8
9 7 12
4 14 1
If you delete a single element from a matrix, the result is not a matrix anymore. So,
expressions like
X(1,2) = []
result in an error. However, using a single subscript deletes a single element, or sequence
of elements, and reshapes the remaining elements into a row vector. So
X(2:2:10) = []
results in
X =
16 9 2 7 13 12 1
